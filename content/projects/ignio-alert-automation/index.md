### Highlights
* Reduced duplicate alerts by 80%
* Smart handling of alerts by using Probable cause analysis to find the root cause and fix them, ignoring other dependant tasks
* Created adapters to integrate ignio with ServiceNow, Solarwinds and AppDynamics using REST API
* Created dynamic profiling of systems, VMs, Applications, Databases, Network and storage entities
* Using dynamic profiles, predicting if the alert is valid for the given conditions
* Auto verify and apply self-healing scripts to address those alerts
* Automated more than 90% of repeated IT Alert and hence enabling technical team to work on solutioning rather than monitoring and troubleshooting
