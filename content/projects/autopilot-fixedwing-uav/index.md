### Highlights
* Equation of the motion is derived with 12 DOF, analyzed for stability and PID controllers are constructed for controlling roll, pitch, altitude, course, airspeed with throttle and airspeed with pitch, considering trim conditions. State machine is build for switching between different flying modes. Controller gains are tuned, and code implemented in python/C++ and tested with Gazebo simulation in ROS environment
